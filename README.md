# Hi there 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

##  🔭  About Me
I'm a Software Architect and Software Engineer with a passion for blockchain, machine learning, and software quality.

### 🌱 Fields

- Actually, I'm working in many fields. Software Architecture is, for me, an additional qualification. In my view, practical work is essential. If a software architect loses the feeling for programming and DevOps topics, he couldn't develop modern software systems in the long run. Modern software systems could not design from the Ivory Tower.

- My main topics are the planning of software systems, blockchain, and machine learning. Database and Cloud systems are also essential skills to plan and run modern software architectures.
