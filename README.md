# Hi there 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

##  🔭  About Me
- I'm a Software Architect and Software Engineer with a passion for blockchain, machine learning, databases, and software quality.

### 🌱 Fields

- Actually, I'm working in many fields. Software Architecture is, for me, an additional qualification. Practical work is essential. If a software architect loses the desire to learn programming and DevOps topics, the architect can't develop modern software systems in the long run. Modern software systems could not be designed from the Ivory Tower.

- My main topics are the planning of software systems, blockchain, and machine learning. Database and Cloud systems are essential for planning and running modern software architectures.

### 👨‍🎓 Education

- I'm a certified [iSAQB Software Architecture Advance Level](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/). I hold certifications and Nanodegrees in Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Finance. You find a list of all my qualifications in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanzils/).

## 👷 Currently Working
- Since my master's thesis, I have worked on the business aspect of distributed ledger systems (blockchains). It is also essential to understand and make business values with such systems. Cryptocurrencies can be much more than speculative assets. [Blog Article: A trusted Database for Systems Boundaries](https://zils-kaisersesch.de/post/2020-01-15-blockchain-a-trusted-database).
- Software Quality is the knowledge about technical debt—Test-driven Development and document software systems. At Inoatec, we use [arc42](https://arc42.org/) as a document standard. I am impressed with the possibilities of tools like [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/en/).
- Agile methods and Extrem programming brought many new aspects to modern software development. In a fast-moving business, it's essential to think about this aspect. However, only some companies need an agile transformation. ([Blog Article: Burnt, can a star chef act agile?](https://zils-kaisersesch.de/post/2021-10-17-burnt/)).

## 🚵‍♂️ Software is not only about Computers! -- [Peopleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware) --
- I believe in teams, aspects of the agile manifesto, and the possibilities of modern technologies. Also, on a good heart, thank you to [@LauraT](https://github.com/ltruncel).
- On the business side, I believe in continuous learning and agile enterprises. Founders like [Götz Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tz_Werner) or the impressed and extraordinary [Margarete Steiff (Inventor of the Teddy Bear)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Steiff) lived these values along before the agile manifesto.
