# Hi there 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

##  🔭  About Me
I'm a Software Architect and Software Engineer with a passion for blockchain, machine learning, and software quality.

### 🌱 Fields

- Actually, I'm working in many fields. Software Architecture is for additional qualification. In my opinion, if a software architect loses the feeling for programming, databases, and DevOps topics couldn't plan software systems in the long run. Modern software systems couldn't design from the Ivory Tower.
