# Hi there üëã Thanks for stopping by!

##  üî≠  About Me
- I'm a Software Architect and Software Engineer with a passion for blockchain, machine learning, and software quality.

### üå± Fields

- Actually, I'm working in many fields. Software Architecture is, for me, an additional qualification. In my view, practical work is essential. If a software architect loses the feeling for programming and DevOps topics, the architect couldn't develop modern software systems in the long run. Modern software systems could not design from the Ivory Tower.

- My main topics are the planning of software systems, blockchain, and machine learning. Database and Cloud systems are also essential skills to plan and run modern software architectures.

### üë®‚Äçüéì Education

- I'm a certified [iSAQB Software Architecture Advance Level](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/). I hold certifications and Nanodegrees in Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Finance. In my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanzils/), you find a list of all my qualifications.

## üë∑ Currently Working
- Since my master thesis, I work on the business aspect of distributed ledger systems (blockchains). For me is also important to understand and make business values with such systems. Cryptocurrencies can be much more than speculative assets. [Blog Article: A trusted Database for Systems Boundaries](https://zils-kaisersesch.de/2020/01/15/a-trusted-database-for-systems-boundaries/).
- Software Quality is the knowledge about technical debt‚ÄîTest-driven Development and also well document software. At Inoatec, we use [arc42](https://arc42.org/) as a document standard. I am impressed with the possibilities from tools like [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/en/).
- Agile methods and Extrem programming brought many new aspects to modern software development. In a fast-moving business, it's essential to think about this aspect. But not every company needs an agile transformation. ([Blog Article: Burnt, can a star chef act agile?](https://zils-kaisersesch.de/2021/01/30/burnt-can-a-star-chef-act-agile/)).

## üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Software is not only about Computers! -- [Peopleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware) --
- I believe in teams, aspects of the agile manifesto, the possibilities of modern technologies. Also, on a good heart, thank you to [@LauraT](https://github.com/ltruncel).
- On the business side, I believe in continuous learning, agile enterprises. Founders like [G√∂tz Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tz_Werner) or the impressed and extraordinary [Margarete Steiff (Inventor of the Teddy Bear)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Steiff) lived this value along before the agile manifesto.
