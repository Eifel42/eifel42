# Hi there 👋 Thanks for stopping by!

##  🔭  About Me
- I'm a Software Architect and Software Engineer with a passion for blockchain, machine learning, and software quality.

### 🌱 Fields

- Actually, I'm working in many fields. Software Architecture is, for me, an additional qualification. In my view, practical work is essential. If a software architect loses the feeling for programming and DevOps topics, he couldn't develop modern software systems in the long run. Modern software systems could not design from the Ivory Tower.

- My main topics are the planning of software systems, blockchain, and machine learning. Database and Cloud systems are also essential skills to plan and run modern software architectures.

### 👨‍🎓 Education

- I'm a certified [iSAQB Software Architecture Advance Level](https://www.isaqb.org/certifications/cpsa-certifications/cpsa-advanced-level/). I hold certifications and Nanodegrees in Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Finance. In my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanzils/), you find a list of all my qualifications.

## 👷 Currently Working
- Since my master thesis, I work on the business aspect of distributed ledger systems blockchain. For me is also important to understand and make business values with such systems. Cryptocurrencies can be much more than speculative assets. [Blog Article A trusted Database for Systems Boundaries](https://zils-kaisersesch.de/2020/01/15/a-trusted-database-for-systems-boundaries/).
